# git-log-as-object

The `git-log-as-object` module allows for the asynchronous gathering of commit metadata for any range of commits within a local git repository.

## gitLog(dir?: string, startRef?: string, endRef?: string): Promise<Commit[]>

Asynchronously fetches the metadata of all commits within a particular reference range.

### Parameters

 * **dir**: The path to the root directory of a git repository. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
 * **startRef**: A reference string, such as a commit hash or tag name, which designates the beginning of the range (exclusive.) If not defined, all ancestors of endRef will be listed.
 * **endRef**: A reference string, such as a commit hash or tag name, which designates the end of the range (inclusive.) If not defined, endRef will be assumed to be 'HEAD'.

### Return

A Promise for an array of Commit objects containing the metadata of each commit in the range. (See *Commit Format* below.)

## gitLogSync(dir?: string, startRef?: string, endRef?: string): Commit[]

Synchronously fetches the metadata of all commits within a particular reference range.

### Parameters

 * **dir**: The path to the root directory of a git repository. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
 * **startRef**: A reference string, such as a commit hash or tag name, which designates the beginning of the range (exclusive.) If not defined, all ancestors of endRef will be listed.
 * **endRef**: A reference string, such as a commit hash or tag name, which designates the end of the range (inclusive.) If not defined, endRef will be assumed to be 'HEAD'.

### Return

An array of Commit objects containing the metadata of each commit in the range. (See *Commit Format* below.)

## Commit Format

The Commit object provided by these functions takes the following form:

```js
{
  "fullHash": // The full SHA1 hash of the commit
  "partialHash": // The abbreviated SHA1 hash of the commit
  "author": {
    "name": // The name provided for the commit author, before application of any mailmap
    "email": // The e-mail address provided for the commit author, before application of any mailmap
  },
  "authorTime": // A JavaScript Date object representing the time the commit was authored
  "committer": {
    "name": // The name provided for the committer, before application of any mailmap
    "email": // The e-mail address provided for the committer, before application of any mailmap
  },
  "commitTime": // A JavaScript Date object representing the time the commit was authored
  "subject": // A single-line string containing the subject line of the commit
  "body": // A potentially multiple-line string containing the rest of the commit message
}
```
